## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to customise radio buttons - I had to find some ideas from different links on google - I don't have the links anymore though. I also learned that the forEach array method does not exit when returning.

### Continued development

I will keep doing the challenges to gain more exposure to different requirements that could be faced in the real world
